# PrismaJS - Budget -> PartBudget -> Part

In PrimaJS, which is often associated with database operations in a Node.js context, you can implement a sequence of writes with rollback capabilities by using transactions. Transactions allow you to group a sequence of operations and ensure that either all the operations succeed or none of them are applied, which is what you want when you need to ensure consistency (i.e., rolling back if any part of the sequence fails).

Here’s how you can approach it for creating a budget and associating products, using a transactional model:

Steps to Implement a Transaction with Rollback in PrimaJS
Start a Transaction: Begin a transaction before you start performing the sequence of writes.
Perform Sequential Writes: Execute the database operations in sequence, writing data to create the budget and the products associated with it.
Commit the Transaction: If all operations are successful, commit the transaction, which will persist all changes to the database.
Rollback on Failure: If any of the operations fail, roll back the transaction, which will undo all changes made during the transaction.
Example Code
Below is an example in JavaScript using PrimaJS and assuming you're working with a relational database. We'll create a budget and sequentially insert associated products into it. If any part fails, all changes will be rolled back.

```javascript
const { PrismaClient } = require("@prisma/client");
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function createBudgetWithProducts(budgetData, productData) {
  // Start a transaction
  const transaction = await prisma.$transaction(async (prisma) => {
    try {
      // Create the budget (assuming 'budget' is your model)
      const budget = await prisma.budget.create({
        data: {
          ...budgetData,
        },
      });

      // Sequentially add products to the budget (assuming 'product' is your model)
      for (let product of productData) {
        await prisma.product.create({
          data: {
            name: product.name,
            price: product.price,
            budgetId: budget.id, // Associate with the newly created budget
          },
        });
      }

      // If we reach here, all operations were successful, commit the transaction
      return true;
    } catch (error) {
      // If any error occurs, rollback the transaction
      console.error("Error occurred, rolling back transaction:", error);
      throw error; // Throwing the error causes the transaction to roll back
    }
  });

  return transaction;
}

// Sample usage
const budgetData = { title: "My Budget", totalAmount: 1000 };
const productData = [
  { name: "Product 1", price: 200 },
  { name: "Product 2", price: 300 },
  { name: "Product 3", price: 500 },
];

createBudgetWithProducts(budgetData, productData)
  .then((result) => {
    if (result) {
      console.log("Budget and products created successfully");
    }
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Failed to create budget and products", error);
  });
```

Explanation:
Transaction Handling: prisma.$transaction ensures that all operations are part of the same transaction. The transaction will either be fully committed or rolled back.

Sequential Writes: We first create the budget and then, in a loop, create products associated with that budget. If any product creation fails, the transaction will automatically roll back.

Rollback on Failure: If any error is thrown inside the try block (e.g., if there's an issue with the database), the transaction will be rolled back, undoing all the changes made so far.

Commit: If everything succeeds, the transaction is committed automatically when the function resolves successfully.

Notes:
Error Handling: By throwing the error in the catch block, Prisma knows that the transaction should be rolled back. If you don't throw the error, Prisma might not know the transaction failed, and it could commit partial changes.

Prisma Models: Make sure that your budget and product models are properly set up with the necessary relationships. For example, product should have a foreign key reference (budgetId) to the budget model.

Transaction Scope: You can also use prisma.$transaction to wrap multiple operations, even if they're across different models or queries, ensuring atomicity.

Additional Considerations:
Transaction Isolation Levels: You can control the isolation level of the transaction for more complex scenarios (e.g., serializable transactions for strict consistency).

Handling Errors Gracefully: It's a good idea to have a way to handle database connection issues, validation errors, or other failures gracefully.

By using Prisma's transactional capabilities, you can ensure that the operations are atomic, meaning either all succeed or none do, achieving the desired rollback behavior in case of failure.

nice, how prisma performe with nxn tables, budget -> productsBudget -> products
ChatGPT said:

When dealing with many-to-many relationships in a database, especially with NxN tables, Prisma can efficiently handle these relationships using join tables. In your case, you have three entities:

Budget
ProductsBudget (this is likely a join table for the many-to-many relationship between Budget and Product)
Product
Schema Setup for NxN Relationship in Prisma
Given your structure (Budget → ProductsBudget → Product), here’s how we can set up the Prisma schema:

Budget and Product have a many-to-many relationship through the ProductsBudget table.
The ProductsBudget table would store references to both Budget and Product.
Here’s an example Prisma schema setup for these tables:

```prisma
model Budget {
  id           Int             @id @default(autoincrement())
  title        String
  totalAmount  Float
  createdAt    DateTime        @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime        @updatedAt
  products     Product[]       @relation("ProductsOnBudget", through: "ProductsBudget")
}

model Product {
  id           Int             @id @default(autoincrement())
  name         String
  price        Float
  createdAt    DateTime        @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime        @updatedAt
  budgets      Budget[]        @relation("ProductsOnBudget", through: "ProductsBudget")
}

model ProductsBudget {
  budgetId     Int
  productId    Int
  quantity     Int

  budget       Budget   @relation(fields: [budgetId], references: [id])
  product      Product  @relation(fields: [productId], references: [id])

  @@id([budgetId, productId])  // Composite primary key
}
```

Explanation of the Schema:
Budget and Product models are linked via the ProductsBudget join table.
The ProductsBudget model has foreign keys budgetId and productId, which reference the Budget and Product models, respectively. This makes it a many-to-many relationship.
The @@id([budgetId, productId]) creates a composite primary key for the ProductsBudget table, ensuring that each budget-product combination is unique.
How to Handle Operations (Insert, Update, Delete) with NxN Relationships
Now let’s look at how you can perform operations like adding products to a budget, removing them, or rolling back a sequence of operations involving these NxN tables.

Example: Adding Products to a Budget
You want to add a budget and then link products to it. Here's an example of how to do that, ensuring a rollback if something fails:

```javascript
const { PrismaClient } = require("@prisma/client");
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function createBudgetWithProducts(budgetData, productData) {
  const transaction = await prisma.$transaction(async (prisma) => {
    try {
      // Create a new Budget
      const budget = await prisma.budget.create({
        data: {
          title: budgetData.title,
          totalAmount: budgetData.totalAmount,
        },
      });

      // Add products to the budget
      for (let product of productData) {
        const existingProduct = await prisma.product.upsert({
          where: { name: product.name },
          update: {}, // No update necessary, we're only checking for existence
          create: {
            name: product.name,
            price: product.price,
          },
        });

        // Link the product to the budget via the ProductsBudget table
        await prisma.productsBudget.create({
          data: {
            budgetId: budget.id,
            productId: existingProduct.id,
            quantity: product.quantity, // Assuming you have a quantity field
          },
        });
      }

      // Commit if everything goes well
      return true;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error occurred, rolling back transaction:", error);
      throw error; // This will trigger the rollback
    }
  });

  return transaction;
}

// Sample data
const budgetData = { title: "Office Budget", totalAmount: 5000 };
const productData = [
  { name: "Laptop", price: 1200, quantity: 3 },
  { name: "Desk", price: 300, quantity: 5 },
  { name: "Chair", price: 150, quantity: 5 },
];

createBudgetWithProducts(budgetData, productData)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Budget and products linked successfully");
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Failed to link budget with products", error);
  });
```

Explanation:
Upsert Product: First, we check if the product exists using upsert. If the product exists, we don’t create a new one; otherwise, we create a new product.
ProductsBudget Table: The relationship between Budget and Product is managed through the ProductsBudget table. Each product is associated with the budget via the budgetId and productId fields.
Rollback on Failure: If any part of the transaction fails (e.g., an error while inserting a product or linking it), the transaction will be rolled back, and no changes will be persisted.
Handling Updates and Deletions
Updating Relationships: If you want to update the quantity or any other property in the ProductsBudget table, you can use Prisma’s update method.

Example:

```javascript
await prisma.productsBudget.update({
  where: {
    budgetId_productId: {
      budgetId: budget.id,
      productId: product.id,
    },
  },
  data: {
    quantity: newQuantity, // Update the quantity for the existing product in the budget
  },
});
Removing Products from Budget: To remove a product from a budget, you can simply delete the row in the ProductsBudget table:

javascript
Copy code
await prisma.productsBudget.delete({
  where: {
    budgetId_productId: {
      budgetId: budget.id,
      productId: product.id,
    },
  },
});

```

How Prisma Performs in NxN Relationships:
Efficiency: Prisma can handle NxN relationships efficiently by using the appropriate indexes (composite primary keys in this case) and ensuring that the necessary foreign keys are indexed.
Transactions: Prisma’s support for transactions ensures that changes to multiple related tables (like Budget, Product, and ProductsBudget) are atomic, either all or none are persisted.
Consistency: The join table (ProductsBudget) allows for fine-grained control over relationships, such as adding quantities or other attributes that describe the relationship between a budget and a product.
Considerations for Large NxN Tables:
If you're dealing with large datasets, consider:

Indexing: Ensure foreign key fields (budgetId, productId) are indexed for faster lookups.
Batch Operations: If adding a lot of products at once, consider batch processing to optimize performance.
By using the ProductsBudget join table, Prisma can effectively manage many-to-many relationships with complex data models like the one you described, ensuring you maintain referential integrity, consistency, and support for complex operations like transactions.
